In this project we controlled the robot to the goal using the A star algorithm.

First, we simulate the map for the robot using matlab software at a uniform scale for coppeliaSim and then plan the robot's path:

After planning the path for the robot and then transferring the coordinates in the path obtained from the star algorithm and combining it with the PID controller so that the robot in coppeliaSim runs:
